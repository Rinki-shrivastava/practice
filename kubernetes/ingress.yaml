It seems you're referring to Kubernetes Ingress. An Ingress in Kubernetes is an API object that manages external access to services within a cluster. An Ingress controller fulfills the Ingress, usually by providing reverse proxy functionality, such as NGINX or HAProxy.

Below is an example of a basic Ingress YAML file:

Copy code
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: example-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
spec:
  rules:
  - host: example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /app
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: app-service
            port:
              number: 80

# Explanation:

# apiVersion: Specifies the API version of the Ingress resource.
# kind: Specifies the kind of Kubernetes resource, which is Ingress in this case.
# metadata: Contains metadata such as the name and annotations of the Ingress resource.
# annotations: Additional configuration or metadata for the Ingress controller.
# spec: Specifies the desired state of the Ingress resource.
# rules: Defines a set of routing rules.
# host: The hostname that the Ingress will route traffic for.
# http: Specifies HTTP-specific routing rules.
# paths: Specifies different paths and how they should be routed.
# path: The URL path prefix to match.
# pathType: Specifies how the path should be matched (Prefix, Exact, ImplementationSpecific).
# backend: Specifies the backend service to route traffic to.
# service: Specifies the name of the Kubernetes service to route traffic to.
# port: Specifies the port of the backend service.
# In this example, any traffic coming to example.com/app will be routed to the app-service 
# Kubernetes service on port 80. You can customize this YAML file based on your specific requirements and 
# the capabilities of your Ingress controller.
