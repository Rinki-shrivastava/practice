# Use the official Node.js 14 image as the base
FROM node:14

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json to the working directory
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code to the working directory
COPY . .

# Expose port 3000 to allow communication with the Node.js application
EXPOSE 3000

# Command to run the Node.js application
CMD ["node", "index.js"]

#   In this example:

#    We start with a comment specifying the base image.
#    We set the working directory inside the container.
#    We copy package.json and package-lock.json to the working directory and install dependencies using npm.
#    We copy the rest of the application code.
#    We expose port 3000 to allow communication with the Node.js application.
#    Finally, we specify the command to run the Node.js application.
